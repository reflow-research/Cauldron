Semantic validation summary
- Main matrix script: local ad-hoc runner (not vendored)
- Template logs: local runtime artifacts (not vendored)
- Consolidated CSV: docs/validation/devnet-semantic-2026-02-07.csv

Vendoring note:
- `/tmp` paths from the original run were intentionally removed.
- If you rerun validation, write logs under `docs/validation/logs/` or another repo-relative path.

Note on custom template:
- Initial matrix attempt failed due input size mismatch (64B provided vs input_blob_size=1024).
- Corrected run used 1024-byte input and passed.

Note on output_len=0 observations:
- Immediate reads after invoke can return stale state on devnet.
- Polling account state after invoke returned finalized non-zero output_len and expected outputs.
