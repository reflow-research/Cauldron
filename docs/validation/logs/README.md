# Validation Logs

This directory is the repo-relative location for semantic validation run logs.

- Expected files match the `primary_log` column in `docs/validation/devnet-semantic-2026-02-07.csv`.
- Logs are local runtime artifacts and are not required for normal repo usage.
- If you rerun the matrix, write logs here instead of `/tmp` so paths remain portable.
